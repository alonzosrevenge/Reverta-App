# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

The application uses a modern React-based frontend with TypeScript:

- **React 18** with functional components and hooks
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server for fast hot module replacement
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing instead of React Router
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with a custom design system
- **shadcn/ui** component library for consistent UI components using Radix UI primitives

The frontend follows a component-based architecture with:
- Page components in `client/src/pages/`
- Reusable UI components in `client/src/components/ui/`
- Custom hooks in `client/src/hooks/`
- Utility functions in `client/src/lib/`

## Backend Architecture

The backend is built with Express.js using TypeScript:

- **Express.js** server with middleware for JSON parsing and request logging
- **Node.js** with ESM modules
- Modular route registration system in `server/routes.ts`
- Abstract storage interface pattern with in-memory implementation as default
- Error handling middleware with proper HTTP status codes

## Data Storage Solutions

The application is designed with a flexible storage architecture:

- **Abstract storage interface** (`IStorage`) allows switching between different storage implementations
- **In-memory storage** (`MemStorage`) as the default implementation for development
- **Drizzle ORM** configured for PostgreSQL with schema definitions
- **PostgreSQL** as the target production database with Neon serverless support
- Database migrations managed through Drizzle Kit

## Authentication and Authorization

Currently, the authentication system is minimal with:
- Basic user schema with username/password fields
- Zod validation schemas for user input
- Storage interface methods for user CRUD operations
- Session handling prepared with `connect-pg-simple` for PostgreSQL sessions

## State Management

- **TanStack Query (React Query)** for server state management and data fetching
- Custom query client configuration with error handling
- API request utilities with credential-based authentication
- Toast notifications for user feedback using Radix UI Toast

## Styling and Theme System

- **Tailwind CSS** with custom configuration
- **CSS custom properties** for theme colors and design tokens
- **Neutral color scheme** as the base theme
- **Inter font family** for typography
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Development Workflow

- **TypeScript** for type safety across the entire stack
- **ESBuild** for production bundling
- **TSX** for development server with hot reloading
- Path aliases for clean imports (`@/` for client, `@shared/` for shared code)
- Development and production build scripts
